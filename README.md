Documentation
-------------

This is my little repository where I'll try to play around with code snippets.

I'll try my best to add proper documentation to what I am doing.  I'm enjoying Vagrant and spinning up a little virtual machine for each coding thing I do.  It sounds tedious but it keeps my computer clean and can help others spin up a machine and use this code if they wanted to play with it.  

I'm gonna try to add the Vagrantfile and provisions I use for each project to help anyone who wants to fuss with my noobish code :).
